# Layouts
Just a repository where I hope to display some of the layouts I have worked on either on my freetime or during courses. I will keep adding the ones I have locally here. All layouts are created with Figma, but I have used Adobe XD before as well. Files contain a pdf of the layouts, and in some cases the .fig file as well.

### Appropassi
During COMP.SE.610 Software Engineering Project 1, our group created an application for Appro participants to use for digitally gathering the appro stamps instead of the old pen and paper version. For this to work we created a participant mobile app, managerial web application for the event organizers and an QR-display for the participating restaurants.

I worked on the adminside frontend team, with whom we created layouts and later implemented them with React/MaterialUI.

### Beerpong App
A layout for a mobile site I am working on to help my friends keep track of who is winning in their ongoing beerpong tournaments. Currently just for two players,
but in the future I would like to make it so anyone can use it. Wanted to keep it nice and simple, to make it easy to add results inbetween games. I will probably first implement the basic view and addition modal, and then start working on the statistics page.

### Ratikkavahti

I often find myself checking the arrival times of the tramway near my home in Tampere. This takes a few clicks, so I thought that making an app that easily shows the arrival times of the tramstop near you would be usefull.
