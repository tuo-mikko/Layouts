# Layouts
Just a repository where I hope to display some of the layouts I have worked on either on my freetime or during courses. I will keep adding the ones I have locally here. All layouts are created with Figma, but I have used Adobe XD before as well. Files contain a pdf of the layouts, and in some cases the .fig file as well.

### Appropassi
During COMP.SE.610 Software Engineering Project 1, our group created an application for Appro participants to use instead of the old pen and paper version.
I worked on the frontend team, with whom we created layouts and later implemented them with React/MaterialUI.

### Beerpong App
A layout for a mobile site I am working on to help my friends keep track of who is winning in their ongoing beerpong tournaments. Currently just for two players,
but in the future I would like to make it so anyone can use it. Wanted to keep it nice and simple, to make it easy to add results inbetween games. I will probably first implement the basic view and addition modal, and then start working on the statistics page.
